# Dotfiles Principles

## Installation Hierarchy

1. **chezmoi first**: Always use chezmoi for installations and configuration management
2. **mise second**: Use mise only when chezmoi is unsuitable (e.g., installing chezmoi itself)
3. **Direct installation last**: Use direct installations (apt, etc.) only when both chezmoi and mise are unsuitable

## Profile Management

- Dotfiles profiles are stored in the `profiles/` directory
- Each profile contains its specific configurations and installation requirements
- Single unified entry point for profile installation via install script

## Ultimate Goal

Host a shell script on GitHub Pages (e.g., fx.github.io/dotfiles/install.sh) that can be run via:
```bash
curl -sSL fx.github.io/dotfiles/install.sh | sh
```

This script should work on any Linux distribution and handle profile selection.
