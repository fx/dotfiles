# Dotfiles Principles

## Installation Hierarchy

1. **chezmoi first**: Always use chezmoi for installations and configuration management
2. **mise second**: Use mise only when chezmoi is unsuitable (e.g., installing chezmoi itself)
3. **Direct installation last**: Use direct installations (apt, etc.) only when both chezmoi and mise are unsuitable

## Profile Management

- Dotfiles use chezmoi's template system with a `profile` variable
- Profiles are defined in `profiles.yaml` for documentation
- Installation uses `--promptString profile=NAME` to set the profile
- Files are conditionally installed based on `{{ if eq .profile "name" }}` templates
- Shared configurations (like claude) are symlinked conditionally based on profile

## Ultimate Goal

Host a shell script on GitHub Pages (e.g., fx.github.io/dotfiles/install.sh) that can be run via:
```bash
curl -sSL fx.github.io/dotfiles/install.sh | sh
```

This script should work on any Linux distribution and handle profile selection.
